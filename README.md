Not everyone has a Wooting or the new Razer keyboard. So why not make it available for everyone?
This might not work on valorant and may get you banned.

### Q: How do I install this? 
A: To install this download the file and add it to ```C:\Program Files\obs-studio\data\obs-plugins\frontend-tools\scripts```.
However not everyone might have it installed in the C: drive. You will need to find your OBS installation.

### Q: I don't want to use OBS to get SOCD. What is my alternative?
A: Use the AHK script included however stuff like that might even have a higher risk of bans.
