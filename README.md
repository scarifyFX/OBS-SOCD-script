## What does Global SOCD do?
Without it if you were to move to the right while holding down the left key it would stop the player.

With **Global SOCD** if you were to move in the opposite direction of your current movement it will do it successfully instead of stopping.

### How do I get Snap Tap / SOCD on my normal keyboard?
To get SOCD on your keyboard go to [releases](https://github.com/ytcyde/Global-SOCD-script/releases/latest) and install the latest EXE. Alternatively for AHK or python go to [python](https://github.com/ytcyde/Global-SOCD-script/blob/main/socd.py) & [AHK](https://github.com/ytcyde/Global-SOCD-script/blob/main/SOCD.ahk).

## What is Global SOCD?
Not everyone has a Wooting or the new Razer keyboard. So why not make it available for everyone?

**Global SOCD** aims to give everyone an alternative to Razers Snap Tap or Woothing SOCD by making it accessible to everyone.

**Global SOCD** does not modify or maliciously interact with the files or resources of any game.

This might not work on **Valorant** and may get you **banned**.
